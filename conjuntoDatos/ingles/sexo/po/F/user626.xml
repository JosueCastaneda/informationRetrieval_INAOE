when paths cross the term to best describe the speed at which i do things is definitely haul ass. now we play the wait for my stop game think i might be changing my bus route organize and alphabetize all day #worktweet i never meant to hurt anyone, i just didn't want to hurt anymore either. the lonely stoner seems to free her mind at night. fuck the past few days. i could really go for some coffee right now, but i think i'll settle for a bowl instead "yeah? you too pal!" could be one of my catch phrases #brooklynborn toll bridge trolls need to eat too. today the paychecks come in, and even though i can't deposit until tomorrow morning, i can't fucking wait!! seems like i should have my #jawboneup back finally!! boo yah! upgrading my room she always calls right when i'm getting ready to leave for work -.- lol, word? aight then. shaken my ass while i hit the bong, cause it makes me feel so damn good there's still some hood rat in me. time to slip on something a little more comfortable and hit the bong. don't need saving, cause there's no salvation for a bad girl 3and a half hours till i can get back to where i wanna be. cabin in the woods. ???? fuck yes to this movie. simply that. fuck yes. #elysium was pretty cool ???? oh my god, i wish i could figure out what i did to my left shoulder/arm, cause it hurts like a motherfucker!! i hate these games.... do what you will. looks like i'll be taking the bus a lot more woke up to some static and stress rewind. think im'a wake up to a bowl instead. see, what he had meant to say is "when a child is bad" but what he had said is "when a person is bad" ey!! neighborhood rules apply!! you ain't seen nuthen, you ain't heard nuthen, you don't know nuthen. #thingsisayatwork over the hills and far away, she prays that he'll return someday. as sure as the river meets the sea, back in his arms he swears she'll be nothing to do for the next hour when you don't even get a goodbye and you don't hear from someone all day << i guess they realized i don't have shit to do either so they sent me home early. right after my bus left. so now i'm waiting minutes for the next bus. wow. fuck you and your bad manners so ready to be home already i'm just blowin in the wind. ready for the worst. well i feel sufficiently stupid. whatever. i'm done bothering for now ???? almost put my stuff i'm the wrong grinder, whoops! lol i'm smirken sooooo hard. fuck that. laughing. this deserves a bowl it's so damn glorious. coughing my ass off, the "i'm getting high" alarm is sounding decided to make a coconut pastry cream tart topped with mango, pineapple, papaya, lychee, etc. for mom's birthday ???? sitting here trying to figure out what this all means... i'm just gonna sit here and wish you missed me too... he speaks in terms of centuries. time to get ready for work. made the arrangements for my moms birthday like a responsible adult. still got minutes before the market opens so i can grab the last of what i need just enough time to get high ???? i am in love with this baby pink lipstick i just got yesterday!! ???????????????? retail people love me. when i go into a store i know precisely what i want, exactly what i'm asking for, and i've already decided to buy it. today is my mothers birthday. #queenleo ????#allhailthequeen ???????????????? time to get my ass up and back on track. but first this message from our cannabinoid receptors! whatever so glad to be home and reaching for the bong. i'm so tired, but got so much to do ???? trying to remember who i was ???? fuck yeah new ghost adventures today! ugh. put my favorite lipstick through the wash. still usable though. but really, lesson learned. trust my least favorite manager to fuck up my chances at catching the bus that would have had me home already at least they were teaching me to serve beer and wines today :) ???????? up late. up early. a protein rich breakfast before i smoke a bowl. #getfit my goals have evolved. i don't give a fuck how tired you are, this is where anxiety can take you #insomnia #sleepplease soooo sore and exhausted. i'll just be grateful i'm hereto hit this bong and that i've got this bong to hit. i'm in so much fucking pain. can't decide if i'm gonna just hit the bing and grab on to some sleep, or grab some munching a first i'm leaning toward "bong" #truth there's a piggy off my coast of the bed, snuffling for skritches ???? thc, then protein, then get stoned out of my mind #morningswithmcfly increasing my intake. i'm tired of not being enough. new #gac just in time for me to enjoy before i head to work? yes yes yes!!! ugh. can't even right now. it wouldn't even be a big deal if i wasn't so fucking hungry. i can now serve beer, wines and some of our signature cocktails! ???????????????????? started at the bottom but i'm coming up like a beast. i missed my intended early bus, so i hit the bong instead ughhhh my luck <<<< haven't even gotten to work and i desperately need a shower and to wash my clothes already, if that says anything about my day so far... the good thing about having luck like mine is its helped make my outlook this: it's a bummer for the first seconds, then there's not much point in anything but laughing it off and planning the next step. nice karmic turn around though with a free bus ride ???? the stench of red bull dozed on the mat for a good minutes living down the block from the high school means i get to listen to the marching band start fucking up bright and early. ???? had my protein and got started on cleaning the kitchen. it's time for some rips before anything else though. reminds me of you i feel sick right now i'm just gonna hit the bong and forget work hours later than i expected. shazam! damn it's cold in my store. wish i hadn't forgotten my hoodie today -.- god my head is killing me. maybe i should eventually eat something today. i think i put my finger on what's bothering me work in hours ugh, can't figure out why my eyes keep tearing up these past weeks.
