 all of this should be discussed with the media, as a secondary point. most important now are transparency, ethics and coi. retweeted, reported. the ethics point about bayonetta isn't quiiite true. did you only read the reddit op? op is for the 'operation'. majority of comments and both other links shoot him down. one guy (+ yes a few supporters) versus a lot of opponents. polygon says "gamergate wants us to do this" it's very misleading. ... damn. i gotta process this for a bit. you have the right to complain. but this is advocating that publishers have power over scores. that's shilling. it's corrupt. it is not reasonable. publishers influencing game scores by withdrawing ad money is hugely damaging to journalism. dude you have made huge mistake promoting 'operation bayonetta'. changing review scores because of publisher pressure is corrupt. good thing she was already kicked from twitter about a week ago then, huh? hate speech? you consider "i think this game is sexist" to be hate speech? eh, i don't think the bayonetta review is 'hate speech'. not really. it says that the sexualization is gratuitous and meaningless. it doesn't say you're horrible for liking that. i'm a bigot because i disagree? seriously, grab a dictionary and look up "bigot", "hate speech" "corruption" and "coercion". saying "i think this uses needless amounts of sexualization" is not hate speech. this isn't gender/sex shaming. it's saying the reviewer doesn't like something. it doesn't judge you for liking tits and ass. good to hear your voice again, and know you're playing games again. makes me happy that you're getting on your feet. =) or, it's because pc gamers' persona. you can't develop games on an xbox or a phone. pc games have mods. pg gamers are engaged. how about you interview some every-day-muslims instead of isil? i.e. people that support gamersgate but aren't harrassholes? this awesome project is still around! get smarter and feed people school meals "nowhere on my site does it say we are journalists". oh? #gamergate hey, can we have a calm & rational discussion without calling names? why exactly do you feel the bayonetta review is hate speech? tags alone don't mean much, anyway. #gamergate #feminism #isis #uspresident #shoes see? look at the whole person, not a tag. i'll send comforting words, but i won't finance their projects because i simply don't agree with them.that makes sense, right? reported for spam. i'm sorry for you. i'm sorry that someone damaged you so much that you now want to see others hurt in the same way. sober is good. relaxation is good. being alive is good, even if it might not always feel that way. don't be an asshole, okay? can you show me? i don't like people harassing anyone. i assume you've already reported twitter? the bravest thing a muslim can do right this moment is to leave the religion. because isis. yeah, that rethoric doesn't fly. decrying an entire group for the actions of a minority isn't the correct way to go. weed out the harassers, not the whole. is the harasser banned/removed yet? so link me there, so i can report. you're making it kind of hard for me to condemn harassment this way. or rather, to act. i'd hardly consider that a bannable offense though. but yeah i'll see if i can calm some people down. dude just stop it. it's not worth the effort because this guy will get offended by pretty much anything. just ignore him. i assume by now you doun they consider pretty much vulgarity a slur and it's no use bothering. if not, well, now you have. you know what, i give up. i tried to be supremely soft, but even that apparently won't do. i hereby condemn harassment. please do not contact me anymore. i hereby condemn all harassments. i feel we should report them, particularly ones about death. here are some egregious ones that hurt me a lot, insulting me as a gamer. can we please report this account for harassment insults and triggering? that does not give him the right to harass all those who didn't. i haven't, yet i am now hurt. you are the one that started messaging them again, despite them clearly not wanting that. i feel like i now also have to report you for spam, unless you stop contacting us from now on. will not ask again. stop contacting us. in return i will not contact you. remove me from your messages and do not contact or mention me again. also don't retweet me. i do not want any more interaction with you whatsoever. this is not a question. well that's not true. comments? poef! weg comments. was it this thread? a case study in youtube promotion and paid promotion disclamer. vandaar: "edit: regarding deletion: the official reason the admin gave me was that it was a fuckup and they reapproved it now." gamergate makes such a big deal? she's been on nyt, msnbc, npr, yet gamergate is the one inserting her into the discussion, instead of the media corps? you mean, directly having a financial tie with the people you report on? "british gamer who disagrees with feminist critiques of gaming culture, argues on her blog" - aangehaald als expert? "cathy young writes a weekly column" - een nieuwsartikel? enjoy: jennyohenry cosmicglider 3lewd5me techyfolks twilightpheonix grass is one of the most essential foilages. it worked wonders in things like trackmania. and charles manson was a vegan. go figure. volkert van der graaf as well. also hitler! clearly these vegans are a bad group. dutch newsshow paints gg as a hate group, uses conflicting footage. take note, be calm, please give them a day to respond cuz office hours. then tomorrow, contact them and calmly explain why you disagree. #gamergate #equality #fairness reported, retweeted. the media reject discourse and keep painting all of gamergate as a hategroup. they tell us to drop the hashtag, because it 1/? is tainted. gg are actively fighting that minority, because they feel the #gamergate hashtag is worth cleaning. if the media so desperately want us to switch hashtags, let them create a clean one, with traction, and move the discussion. notice how the only one of those screenshots with the hashtag attached to it, very quickly got a bunch of reports? the absurd thing is they're not supporting gamergate. they're just against gawker. "the enemy of my enemy" doesn't always apply. no; revolt was based on anger at a dev sleeping with a journalist, a pr person, a boss and an award judge. read them. i agree with you on many points. however i think that a distinction between those who want ethics and those who hide behind 'ethics' is definitely one that should be made. from the start there was this division, and yes, the hashtag is tainted to a degree. but like muslims/isil, christians/kkk, i feel it's unwarranted to ask people to drop the gg hashtag. if anything, journalists should start their own 'fresh' tag with a decent amount of traction, if they want people to switch don't do this. contacting advertisers over bullying is a bit of a grey area but you decide. however this is unethical because there are conflicting interests. you're promoting a publisher to financially pressure a higher score. that is an arguable point, but even if we would agree, the methods you use are unethical. the end doesn't justify these means. personally, scores as a precise number are bullshit, because reviews are very personal, and should serve as an anchoring point i know. i disagreed then as well. i disagree; a reviewer may have biases as long as they're transparent and obvious. and we may criticize them for that. but we may not try to force their opinions away. no it's an attempt at reasoning with you. i'm not preventing you from doing this, i'm saying that what you're doing is promoting developers to force a re-review on one of their games, which would be coercion and would ruin journalistic isolation everthing is seen through a personal lens, though. what makes a story good? what is good gameplay? fast? slow? an impartial-as-possible review would be nothing more than listing mechanics/bugs, and reiterating box quotes. do you think totalbiscuit is a good revie- *cough* first-impressioner? because he acts more along sjp ethics than many 'game journalist' blogs. yet his opinions are strongly personal. example: the intro makes it very clear he doesn't generally like puzzlers or platformers. which is a bias. but because he's frank about it, i can take those biases in to account, if i myself do or don't like them. it's 9:01 here and i'm still awake. give me a few minutes. our core disagreement is about the inclusion of personal opinion and biases, correct? i have to go to work in 20. shush. that's insulting and adds nothing to the discussion. i've reported several doxxers when i could. they are now banned. is that a specific enough denouncement? i generally don"t demounce an perob completery, rather specific actions. example: operatio bayonetta i believe we should focus on bad behavior, not people. everybody makes mistakes. some are stupid, some are vile. i denounce those that are actively inflicting harm, i try to esucate those who are dumb or ununformed. those two accounts i mentioned had only negatives. they're gone now. gotta work again now. sorry for all spelling errors. on a phone and correcting takes too long =p well he's not wrong. sexism is treating someone a particular way because of gender. it doesn't necessarily have to be hate. for example holding open doors for women but not men. it's sexist, it's stupid, but i'd hardly call it hateful behavior.
