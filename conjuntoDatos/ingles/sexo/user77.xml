@username @username  i think ive seen it only a couple of times. No idea why though @username  1° the raid (et de loin) 2° Taken  3° le dernier samaritain 4° Predator @username @username  you never tried playing tic-tac-toe on google doc? remember playing Tag with Reut or Yuval, CFP spmrl 2012 :) @username @username I have to admit that I recently used the svn2git bridge to commit something on github... I'm too old for mercurial I could survive for 73 days in a Zombie apocalypse! http://t.co/iP2TTCOxgH Follow @username for more fun surveys!! #QZombie #SurveySays @username @username you can find one of those postcards on sale here http://t.co/bAf5EwOMLR @username @username not sure the reality is better: rumor has it that the DFKI will have most of the EU NLP money for the years to come @username everyone has already moved to Germany. Haven't you heard about J.vonG. ? @username you were wondering why do people translate your post. That one and its intringuing search request is a good example of why :))))) @username @username  funny. The use of we is prefered in French academia. Even in a thesis (which is supposed to be an individual work). @username As far as I can remember, almost all people I know (French) use we (or sometimes "one" like "one can see in Fig." instead of.. @username .. Curve in Fig x shows that... my two cents: here it's considered vulgar to show off with "I proved", "I'll demonstrate" ... @username .. we prefer to include the reader in the rhetorical argument and make him part of the scientific journey @username lol,  I've seen that a lot and I've done it many times (just checked and all my single auth. papers have it). Is it that wrong @username check that out: it's called "nous de modestie" (modesty we) --> http://t.co/K5awUDiSpH  . it says that its use is favored .. @username .. because  1) it reminds that the author did not start from scratch (shoulders, giants)  and 2) it allows to put the ego away @username  there's even a paper on that very topic (in French) http://t.co/7ttrfyuZSf that guy did some stats apparently (small sample) @username I don't want to be rude but I don't think it was van Baster (who was very white). that must be Gullit @username @username what's the game? @username @username @username  Hey, I didn't  know hebrew2French MT was that accurate. Are you talking about some statues with chainsaws? @username @username @username  the penguins stuff would have been hilarious though :) like the next catchy title of every MTers out there @username Nice :) please tell hi to Laura and the guys :) I’ve wasted 58 days and 23 hours of my life watching TV shows. Calculate your time: http://t.co/A2EqQoUxQW @username too bad this workshop isn't linked to the semeval semantic parsing shared task. Unofficial results are out and they're impressive @username if they're confirmed, surface syntax parsing would be of no use anymore and that would have been something worth discussing #nlp #nlpproc who is up for helping bootsrap a dothraki treebank? would need a lexicon first and @username unsupervized stuff @username  I hope you'll invite the Task organizers to present the task results  because they're groundbreaking. (way above previous tasks) @username seriously, Excel is way better than OpenOffice Calc. And way faster too. @username @username @username don't tell me about it, the whole IR French Industry is still working with Unitex (a rule based system) @username @username @username mainly because it has a fancy interface to design rules, comes with tons and tons of different lexicon @username @username @username and because they all can sell very expensive expertise to adapt them to new domain, etc. @username @username @username what could they sell with a standard ML package ? new data set ? too risky. it's like giving all away #YoManuscript is so bad, you added fake co-authors to share the shame and hide your name in the crowd #YoManuscript is so bad, it's like it has 666 pages, it's written in blood and will cause all reviewers to die before the next moon #YoManuscript is so bad Reviewer #3 sold it to Weird Al Yancovik for his upcoming  Benny Hill's theme song cover @username @username what did he say about European academic and montague? (what a challenge for 140 char long messages :)) @username we do? well, you probably right. trying to remember last time I've said "la porte était fermée je te dis !!!"  if I meant "à clef".. @username @username @username  Only if they have a catchy title, otherwise they're screwed. Oh, "cool" tweeter has become some kind of Facebookstein..  it's doomed. @username wtf? @username @username how about the misnomers like "French fries" ? @username @username @username well, frontier is blurry between named entities and some mwe. btw, isn't capital always needed? @username @username @username :) we're going to be doomed anyway when parsing stuffs like "I love Algerian music from Paris". @username @username @username that would probably require a third field "originofconcept" or something like this the infinite joy of discovering the paper you must review is 62 pages long, due in two weeks and you so don't want to do it. #justsayno is that me or reviewing ate half of people's time this year? #toomanyconfs #justsayno #NLP #NLProc @username  does it really produce this? I've seen a presentation from  S.Pulman and he showed some really baffling examples @username also, do you know if there's  some formal links between the way embeddings are learned and analogy learning? @username I am, I am... nice improvement btw. I'm just puzzled by this france-paris+italie= rome thinggy. @username pulman said something like "first I couldn't believe something could come out from this but it turned I was wrong" 1/2 @username it was a talk on deep learning actually, RNR trained on word embeddings, very interesting (short talk) http://t.co/e56my63Ool @username and by puzzled, I mean totally hallucinating @username well, yes a bit, according to Pullman, it's Paris-France+Italy= Rome (9mn43 on the video) @username I really need to read your paper, @username just told me to RTFP yours :) @username I'm  wondering if this would work with Movies vs Director.. @username My sister says that mommy killed her. Mommy says that I don't have a sister.  (that one from reddit is my favorite) @username  digging into old proceedings (< 90) I found this http://t.co/0t44QtZCsG  you might like it (free word order dep. parsing) :) @username what the fucking fuck !!! worse idea ever: follow some lame fucktards who has nothing better to do than posting photos of cannibalism victims #WTF @username @username @username @username  I'm  a parisian and I didn't know it either. Is it fun for  a 3 years old ? I still can't believe Jack Bauer is back! #palmer4president #jackbauerisback @username @username in all total fairness Cyclops's optic ray is no laser, it's some kind of plasma, pretty much like Havoc's @username at least, there doesn't seem to be 3 months kebbab leftover and a dead pigeon behind the first pile of stuffs.. @username let me guess, you use its heat to keep your lunch warm.. nice light effect on the laptop btw, it looks like it's been instagrammed @username @username worse are end of chapter footnotes, raaaaaah @username @username what's wrong[1] with footnotes ? I like them very much    [1] As I can put little jokes inside a  paper @username nan, that  would disrupt  the reading flow (as I can put little jokes) too much to be super funny (like (Benni Hill et al, 1983)) @username @username @username Hollywood, marshall plan and coca cola I'd say. @username care to share it ?  Some people do that.. @username  yes cool for the paper, but I meant the review itself :) "Depeche Mood: a Lexicon for Emotion Analysis from Crowd Annotated News" best paper title ever. #NeedMoreCatchyTitle #NLPROC #ACL2104 @username Actually I don't, only because the reviews I have are usually used to improve the paper which is them resubmitted.  1/2 @username @username does it. He put online some reviews with some of his papers, turned into technical reports. I found it interesting. 2/3 @username Actually, you can also ask for the review to be unanomized and put them online if they really helped to improve the paper. @username  I've always thought of a way to credit the reviewers when they helped to fix a very important flaw @username @username that should be done in a opt-in basis.. like if I don't mind my rewiew been online, I sign it. @username @username I think i've seen a thread about this in hal daume's blog some years ago. About crediting the reviewers for published papers @username @username I think it'll be cool... @username @username @username on mandatory signature: people may think they were reviewed by concurrent or just not fairly and retaliate @username @username @username you know, I've heard cases of rejection just so the reviewers won't get their own work scooped and .. @username @username @username so signing would be a way to avoid this @username @username @username well, there's always some flaw in a paper and some people can be really convincing at killing a paper @username @username @username I couldn't agree more, I've tried rising this subject at emnlp2012's meeting, and I was unsuccessful @username @username @username that year, there were more than 60 xACL workshops, LREC  and around 10 coling ones. @username @username @username you add all others (Formel Grammer, essli, LACL, etc.) it's more than 100, easily. On a given leap year @username @username @username leap = eacl+coling+lrec+xACL @username @username @username I'd suggest SPMRL but I like it very much  #joke #dontshootme @username @username @username seriously, there should be merged of stuff but it's hard to do and how about small, and technical venues ? @username what do you mean last paper, last week works too... @username @username nice :) How long before people do that on all kind of spelling variation? @username @username even in slang? in French verlan (reverse spelling) we have arabe --> beur (short for be-ara) --> reu-beu  1/2 @username @username but they are so few of them, you're better off with a lexicon or something like dynamic lexical acquisition @username @username  it's not that harder than English :)  both total randomness at play :)  btw, we're working on a new crapbank.. @username @username I've seen so much horror in it, it's like the Replicant's speech  "I've seen things you cannot imagine" @username wasn't that proved for dogs and roosters some years ago? he's so the best at what he does  https://t.co/PNGlb7CrzO #ImaGeekSoSueMe @username they're moving 300km away or is this like a second unit? @username wtf do you mean abandonned? it's been the location of a tv show for the last 20 years, broadcast in idk how many countries @username Woaw, and here I am always playing my sissy in my papers... @username Hi Reut, I know it's none of my business but what does this ht mean #?????????????????? it made google translate explode :) ...
