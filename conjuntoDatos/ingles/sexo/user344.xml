So? :P @username nope, you merely shared a beautiful picture and I like it. ;) How about that Yin Yang flip-flop convo? :P To all gamers stressed out over games...  http://t.co/AmhnBSbztW @username @username *raises hand* @username these meals are a major cause of your acne outbreaks. #GoVeggie or #LessMeat @username at least we can make an approach. :) Why judge someone?

And I experience love for my kids stronger as love for my partner. @username everything? Ok. @username from a logical POV; Yes, I disagree. from your personal POV; as stated Ok. :P @username kinda funny, there are actually multiple POVs here. 1. You doing things for the first time. Ok. 2. You cannot do all things. @username 3. logically every thing can be done for the first time. 4. logically "there is" is present tense, as in the first is already @username here and executed and not considered a potential first time. Summary, dom Ne's are creative. :P @username thnx, I needed that. hmm, I think I am on to something on how to fix ANY COD connection... any Fariko volunteers that wanna test with me? @username @username @username yup, definitely developing European tendencies... speedos. smh. @username I just told you we don't work that way.

And you even continue to change it. /blocked @username @username @username I wasn't referring to the men wearing speedos, but to the focus of naughty K. ;) @username love works in mysterious ways. Change is the key to improvement. http://t.co/1AgxPtwHnt @username spirituality is the operative word. :) @username with dropbox we have had that for years AND including windows and android. Apple seems to become more and more of a copycat. @username merely a balance with a smile between Jung's cognitive functions Te and Fe. :) @username @username what is the current literacy rate amongst muslims? @username planet USApe apparently? @username @username you do realize what "Boko Haram" means? .@username @username the point is: science should be about improving ALL of mankind. Not a matter of groups pounding their chests. @username it is not about dividing people by religions, race, sex or nation. But about joining as one to improve humanity. @username the url you gave merely stated SA, which is highly doubtfull. no USA rates and no European rates. You're a propagandist. @username @username the question is, is he still a writer for Salon and others where he published plagiarized content? .@username nothing much, merely kicking trickshotters/snipers ass in FFA. @username I think @username should adopt you as well if you get 50 RTs. :) @username http://t.co/m4xgBigM5c then http://t.co/tEETWPZ3ZX to find a team @username @username just joining the conga line.
