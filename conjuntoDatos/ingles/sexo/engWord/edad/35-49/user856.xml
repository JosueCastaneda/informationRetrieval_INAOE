when twitter based research is presented i really would like to know where did u get the data (api, firehouse , other...) #mit8 the point is that if you draw conclusions based on "data" at least you should define those data. #mit8 can you repeat the name of the place ? ;-) we're on our way... as soon as we find a way out of mit building to stage protest action we need a script, both #occupy or #gangnam style are scripts. #mit8 "maps are tools we use to do things, they are navigational instead of being mimetics" and a voluntary navigational use of geo data? #mit8 "networked intimacy: a performed relationship of togetherness taking place in a networked public space" #mit8 "i use facebook to state to others that our relationship doesn't need facebook " oh the joy of in-depth interviews. :-) #mit8 "this picture summaries the concept of networked intimacy " ... we want the funniestpicture award. in korean newspaper articles had "twitter" in the headline. #mit8 "twitter can be private for private figures and public for public figures" #mit8 i agree but still you participate a public conversation as a private figure... but i'll forward the point to the presenter #mit8 hashtags are not really used in korean twitter.. they seem to use them only in ironic way #mit8 why the keep changing my to vela even if i don't leave them on the floor?! #kendallhotel #fakegreenpolicy while cctv was a relatively simple technology to subvert... how it can be done with new digital surveillance technology? #mit8 tom pettitt: in the future people will be concerned about the digital version of the medieval honor #mit8 personally i've got some problems with the idea of "new digital versions" of something that happened before. #mit8 agree and i like the historical reconstruction but using already existing categories might lead to blindness for what is new #mit8 "how to make curation in open environment to ensure quality?
