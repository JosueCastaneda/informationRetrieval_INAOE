 i think ive seen it only a couple of times. no idea why though 1° the raid (et de loin) 2° taken 3° le dernier samaritain 4° predator you never tried playing tic-tac-toe on google doc? remember playing tag with reut or yuval, cfp spmrl :) i have to admit that i recently used the svn2git bridge to commit something on github... i'm too old for mercurial i could survive for days in a zombie apocalypse! follow for more fun surveys!! #qzombie #surveysays you can find one of those postcards on sale here not sure the reality is better: rumor has it that the dfki will have most of the eu nlp money for the years to come everyone has already moved to germany. haven't you heard about j.vong. ? you were wondering why do people translate your post. that one and its intringuing search request is a good example of why :))))) funny. the use of we is prefered in french academia. even in a thesis (which is supposed to be an individual work). as far as i can remember, almost all people i know (french) use we (or sometimes "one" like "one can see in fig." instead of.. .. curve in fig x shows that... my two cents: here it's considered vulgar to show off with "i proved", "i'll demonstrate" ... .. we prefer to include the reader in the rhetorical argument and make him part of the scientific journey lol, i've seen that a lot and i've done it many times (just checked and all my single auth. papers have it). is it that wrong check that out: it's called "nous de modestie" (modesty we) --> . it says that its use is favored .. .. because 1) it reminds that the author did not start from scratch (shoulders, giants) and 2) it allows to put the ego away there's even a paper on that very topic (in french) that guy did some stats apparently (small sample) i don't want to be rude but i don't think it was van baster (who was very white). that must be gullit what's the game? hey, i didn't know hebrew2french mt was that accurate. are you talking about some statues with chainsaws? the penguins stuff would have been hilarious though :) like the next catchy title of every mters out there nice :) please tell hi to laura and the guys :) i’ve wasted days and hours of my life watching tv shows. calculate your time: too bad this workshop isn't linked to the semeval semantic parsing shared task. unofficial results are out and they're impressive if they're confirmed, surface syntax parsing would be of no use anymore and that would have been something worth discussing #nlp #nlpproc who is up for helping bootsrap a dothraki treebank? would need a lexicon first and unsupervized stuff i hope you'll invite the task organizers to present the task results because they're groundbreaking. (way above previous tasks) seriously, excel is way better than openoffice calc. and way faster too. don't tell me about it, the whole ir french industry is still working with unitex (a rule based system) mainly because it has a fancy interface to design rules, comes with tons and tons of different lexicon and because they all can sell very expensive expertise to adapt them to new domain, etc. what could they sell with a standard ml package ? new data set ? too risky. it's like giving all away #yomanuscript is so bad, you added fake co-authors to share the shame and hide your name in the crowd #yomanuscript is so bad, it's like it has pages, it's written in blood and will cause all reviewers to die before the next moon #yomanuscript is so bad reviewer #3 sold it to weird al yancovik for his upcoming benny hill's theme song cover what did he say about european academic and montague? (what a challenge for char long messages :)) we do? well, you probably right. trying to remember last time i've said "la porte était fermée je te dis !!!" if i meant "à clef".. only if they have a catchy title, otherwise they're screwed. oh, "cool" tweeter has become some kind of facebookstein.. it's doomed. wtf? how about the misnomers like "french fries" ? well, frontier is blurry between named entities and some mwe. btw, isn't capital always needed? :) we're going to be doomed anyway when parsing stuffs like "i love algerian music from paris". that would probably require a third field "originofconcept" or something like this the infinite joy of discovering the paper you must review is pages long, due in two weeks and you so don't want to do it. #justsayno is that me or reviewing ate half of people's time this year? #toomanyconfs #justsayno #nlp #nlproc does it really produce this? i've seen a presentation from s.pulman and he showed some really baffling examples also, do you know if there's some formal links between the way embeddings are learned and analogy learning? i am, i am... nice improvement btw. i'm just puzzled by this france-paris+italie= rome thinggy. pulman said something like "first i couldn't believe something could come out from this but it turned i was wrong" 1/2 it was a talk on deep learning actually, rnr trained on word embeddings, very interesting (short talk) and by puzzled, i mean totally hallucinating well, yes a bit, according to pullman, it's paris-france+italy= rome (9mn43 on the video) i really need to read your paper, just told me to rtfp yours :) i'm wondering if this would work with movies vs director.. my sister says that mommy killed her. mommy says that i don't have a sister. (that one from reddit is my favorite) digging into old proceedings (< 90) i found this you might like it (free word order dep. parsing) :) what the fucking fuck !!! worse idea ever: follow some lame fucktards who has nothing better to do than posting photos of cannibalism victims #wtf i'm a parisian and i didn't know it either. is it fun for a years old ? i still can't believe jack bauer is back! #palmer4president #jackbauerisback in all total fairness cyclops's optic ray is no laser, it's some kind of plasma, pretty much like havoc's at least, there doesn't seem to be months kebbab leftover and a dead pigeon behind the first pile of stuffs.. let me guess, you use its heat to keep your lunch warm.. nice light effect on the laptop btw, it looks like it's been instagrammed worse are end of chapter footnotes, raaaaaah what's wrong[1] with footnotes ? i like them very much [1] as i can put little jokes inside a paper nan, that would disrupt the reading flow (as i can put little jokes) too much to be super funny (like (benni hill et al, 1983)) hollywood, marshall plan and coca cola i'd say. care to share it ? some people do that.. yes cool for the paper, but i meant the review itself :) "depeche mood: a lexicon for emotion analysis from crowd annotated news" best paper title ever. #needmorecatchytitle #nlproc #acl2104 actually i don't, only because the reviews i have are usually used to improve the paper which is them resubmitted. 1/2 does it. he put online some reviews with some of his papers, turned into technical reports. i found it interesting. 2/3 actually, you can also ask for the review to be unanomized and put them online if they really helped to improve the paper. i've always thought of a way to credit the reviewers when they helped to fix a very important flaw that should be done in a opt-in basis.. like if i don't mind my rewiew been online, i sign it. i think i've seen a thread about this in hal daume's blog some years ago. about crediting the reviewers for published papers i think it'll be cool... on mandatory signature: people may think they were reviewed by concurrent or just not fairly and retaliate you know, i've heard cases of rejection just so the reviewers won't get their own work scooped and .. so signing would be a way to avoid this well, there's always some flaw in a paper and some people can be really convincing at killing a paper i couldn't agree more, i've tried rising this subject at emnlp2012's meeting, and i was unsuccessful that year, there were more than xacl workshops, lrec and around coling ones. you add all others (formel grammer, essli, lacl, etc.) it's more than 100, easily. on a given leap year leap = eacl+coling+lrec+xacl i'd suggest spmrl but i like it very much #joke #dontshootme seriously, there should be merged of stuff but it's hard to do and how about small, and technical venues ? what do you mean last paper, last week works too... nice :) how long before people do that on all kind of spelling variation? even in slang? in french verlan (reverse spelling) we have arabe --> beur (short for be-ara) --> reu-beu 1/2 but they are so few of them, you're better off with a lexicon or something like dynamic lexical acquisition it's not that harder than english :) both total randomness at play :) btw, we're working on a new crapbank.. i've seen so much horror in it, it's like the replicant's speech "i've seen things you cannot imagine" wasn't that proved for dogs and roosters some years ago? he's so the best at what he does #imageeksosueme they're moving 300km away or is this like a second unit? wtf do you mean abandonned? it's been the location of a tv show for the last years, broadcast in idk how many countries woaw, and here i am always playing my sissy in my papers... hi reut, i know it's none of my business but what does this ht mean #?????????????????? it made google translate explode :) ...
