i really need to put my fucking head in the sand for a while. so long internet.. i can't believe the news today, i can't close my eyes and make it go away, how long.. how long must we sing this fucking song #bloodysunday because of course everyone in gazaa did build these tunnels? poor year old kids, forced to digg instead of going to school. assuming you know quite right how to discriminate between right and wrong. sorry i can't, all i see is river of blood. you mean like in when they offered a truce of years? or when the plo recognized israel and signed with ytzahk rabin? même si je dois vivre 000 ans je suis pas prêt d'oublier "wake up, wake up, i bought you a toy" .. j'hallucine ma race putain. how come recommendations from a low self confidence reviewer counts more than those from higher ones? #emnlp2014 #emnlp2014 great they don't read authors responses too. actually from his review, he couldn't make the difference between semantic role labeling and graph-based predicate-argument parsing maybe. or when one is not part of a known clique, entering is much harder. benefice of the doubt so to speak. i've raised that issue at the #emnlp org. meeting and no one seemed to care. anyway, next acl will be in china.. 1/2 i hope they'll consider russia, azerbaidjan or north korea next time. why not after all? great venue, low human right zone disgusting. how about peace damn ass? sorry, that was one guy from a well known antisemitic group, what i've seen was or that one, read "jews and arabs united for justice" please don't believe all fud serioulsy? they're running to save their lives, they have no electricity, almost no water and they should tweet? like those who voted for nethaniayu or lieberman who think it's ok to kill children on a beach, hospital, a school #stfu talking about humain shields when gaza is the most dense zone of the world is like talking about being wet when drowning at sea by the way, they were the ones forcing kids entering houses so they won't get trapped first help? what help ? they've been in an open air prison for years. having no control on their lives whatsoever. 1/2 anyway, you're right, i'm wrong. let's just hope that you'll kill them all in one bombing, at least they won't suffer anymore. of course, like this hasn't been testified by the israelis refuzniks before. don't forget to fuck yourself after they all die you're losing your nerves or what? calm yourself down, go jerk off on some beheaded little kids believing they asked for it. funny, you're talking about evidences now. where the ones proving hamas killed these young kids and so gaza deserved it all? what argument? we were having an argument? here i was i thinking you were a lame asshole telling that those people asked for it while i was supposed to argue with you. i'm not arguing with someone who thinks that those people deserved their sad fate. yes, sure. right, how many people died during the search and rescue operation? how many blown up houses? how many prisoners? fair enough. exactly damn ass. they don't. so stop saying that they got what they deserved because years ago 42.9% voted hamas. how about those voting for the israeli far right? pfff, you don't even see you're going circular on your own argumentation... is that a joke? i feel like being in the hidden camera... i can't believe you wrote this without laughing your ass off democracy, only if they chose the right ones, right? go tell that to bibi when he said he won't talk to abbas anymore and by the way, go fuck yourself deep hard with your lame insults, you're that close to a pity point it's pathetic hoping for the emergence of the next mandela instead of the next intifada. #callmenaive is there a translation of that reportage somewhere? it starts spreading fire on french twitter. d'après le journaliste auteur du reportage, "it is absolutely not true. social media got their translation wrong" it was there before the demonstration. get your facts, check the vid. shame nobody covered it though no, apparently it has been done during the night or the morning. shame, i agree. such a shame.it was supposed to be a peaceful sitting and now salafist flags, staviskas and riots #fml this is the dumbest argument i've ever read. because they're young men, they're by default terrorist or fighter? come on. don't embarrass yourself with that "let's kill them all. we'll check after that. or not." argument yes, sure. said who? i hope you, your little sister and your family will be safe. take care. can't stop following her tweets, wondering if.. not too horrible, i won't tell it out loud. courage farah, courage.. sadly, the past should probably used here "she was live tweeting". i deeply hope i'm wrong. i can't believe you're talking like that to a terrified young girl. wtf for god's sake! dear dr, are you related to ? is she ok? her little sis as well? oh thank god!! please tell her father and everyone we're praying for you all. can we send money or medics? oh thank god!!! i'm so happy you made it! how is your sister and your family? i've never been that happy to be wrong. i'd love to continue to be so wrong 'til the end of the time to be honest exactly what i was thinking too. hope there will be a happy ending for everyone from both sides #callmenaive whatever. because as in many other arab countries, men stay outside at day 1/2 (sorry to interfere,just saw the numbers and translated the question) actually, yes i would. same for children's death rate being lower it's not a matter of proportion, it's a matter of who is protectless because smbdy would be stupid enough to shoot a stinger from inside a house? i wish i could i say i know the feeling but i don't. it's tough though to go as far as empathizing with scared soldiers fucking hell, how far are you in the south ? i thought they were discussing another ceasefire.. it wouldn't set the room on fire? god, i've watched to many stalingrad documentaries hi yoav, because i try to follow "both sides", i'm a scientist 1/2 so i use bing, google translate and all i can to try to understand how come there is such a damn gap between those two sides spent hours reading stuff on the israeli official archive, haaretz.. israel isn't one side either then cf. gideon levy's side vs likoud. religious vs secular, etc. but less and less at leas they can give people so air, no? time to gather victims.. so, are you saying that the current death toll is exagerated? #hope? or by the idf, a lone soldier being bored or a smbd genuinely scared by some guys coming close the no man's land sorry, was off trying to make an over excited baby go to bed (and stay there). although i found this creapy at best, here's one list found from a non neutral source too yeah, feel so hopelessly useless right now. being obsessed by live report, reading saddate in jerusalem, hoping. i will. i hope he'll have some time to follow it is. i don't know how to cope with anything else right now. being obsessed by what is happening. #peace me too, fucking hell.. not that it matters in absolute, but it hard to explain to coworkers who don't give a shit btw is that confirmed that whole tradegy in the play yard today? a hamas misfire? well, wether people care or not, they must pay attention to alerts and stuffs? what's pij ? islamic djihad? as i said it already, totally fucked up. i once said in a paper that social media was a revolution because everyone could become a valuable source of information. so true too bad it's about a fucking surviving game nightmare ? why are you lying about ? she created her twitter in march 2012, not conveniently weeks ago? what do you imply? good luck, with all my care. if that can make you sleep better, go ahead. don't embarrass yourself: 1.8m in 40kmx10km, that's per km2 so, 4.5 per m2. 1/2 add the no go zone increase by 44%, that's about people per square meter now. well, if that makes you sleep better, keep thinking they're evil and the other are good. pffff. following and losing all hope whatsoever.. sure. as opposed to when they were pogrommed in europe for centuries while given asilum by musl. if you knew anything, you'd be able to make the difference between al-quaida wanabee and people. what? she died?? omfg.. hope there's no harm in the neighborhood. you live in the south? any news from ? haven't heard from her in a while, i hope she's ok too. :) no need to. i hope this nightmare will be over soon. (still hoping for an happy ending though) great !! btw, you'll be in dublin next month, right? ok, i'm glad you're ok. i hope you guys will manage to get some money but dublin can be very expensive (+ coling fees) we managed to find cheap housing at trinity via (and yes i know you probably don't care right now) come on dude, this hoax was debunked years ago. you can troll better, try again.. like half of gaza people, she was years old. keep insulting a young girl, you'll feel better so you needed to insult a little girl scared to death instead of taking 2mn to get some facts straight? she deserves to live in a free country, not in an open air prison. she deserves to live her life.
