When Twitter based research is presented I really would like to know where did u get the data (API, Firehouse , other...) #mit8 @username the point is that if you draw conclusions based on "data" at least you should define those data. #mit8 @username  can you repeat the name of the place ? ;-) @username we're on our way... As soon as we find a way out of MIT building to stage protest action we need a script, both #occupy or #gangnam style are scripts. #mit8 "Maps are tools we use to do things, they are navigational instead of being mimetics" and a voluntary navigational use of geo data? #mit8 "Networked intimacy: a performed relationship of togetherness taking place in a networked public space" #mit8 "I use Facebook to state to others that our relationship doesn't need Facebook " oh the joy of in-depth interviews. :-) #mit8 "This picture summaries the concept of networked intimacy " ... We want the funniestpicture award. http://t.co/CqF0hvFEJ3 In 2011 1777 Korean newspaper articles had "twitter" in the headline. #mit8 "Twitter can be private for private figures and public for public figures" #mit8 @username I agree but still you participate a public conversation as a private figure... but I'll forward the point to the presenter #mit8 Hashtags are not really used in Korean Twitter.. they seem to use them only in ironic way #mit8 Why the keep changing my to vela even if I don't leave them on the floor?! #kendallhotel #fakegreenpolicy while CCTV was a relatively simple technology to subvert... how it can be done with new digital surveillance technology? #mit8 Tom Pettitt: In the future people will be concerned about the digital version of the medieval honor #mit8 personally I've got some problems with the idea of "new digital versions" of something that happened before. #mit8 @username agree and I like the historical reconstruction but using already existing categories might lead to blindness for what is new #mit8 @username "How to make curation in open environment to ensure quality? " #mit8 @username Oddio!!! Missing you! I'm at MIT Jack C. Tang Center for Management Education (Building E51) (Cambridge, MA) w/ 3 others http://t.co/XoCilBWJL1 Well that was great!
