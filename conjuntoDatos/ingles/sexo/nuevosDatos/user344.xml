with a touch of creative imagination i know exactly what you mean. :d . the truth is: there is no truth. thank on that notion i'll probably have my next nightmare, so much thanks. worst salesman ever. *turns around, she asked for slim calf boots!?* *other people around start laughing* i admire the climatologists trying to pose a model on this behaviour. climate models are still not reliable. nothing to worry about. the usual gifted wannabe trait of feeling self confidence. :) we used to say no, but we are about to change things. in relation to? roger who? not too shabby i have no real judgement about you being gifted, i merely rephrased it from your profile. and about the perceived narcisism, naeh mate, no worries. read the dsm or wikipedia and judge yourself. you having no balls is not newsworthy. in his case: eunoch. smh. and you favorite your own tweet? narcissistic tendency. :p i'll pull your tail. as usual. :d as in all things in life: balance with a smile. :) both too little and too much swearing can be uncomfortable. aristotle, the first humanist. father of humanity and logical reasoning. :) so much cringe and good in this tweet. but i know it came from a good heart. <3 i have ways to haunt your dreams.... mwhuahahahaaaaaah! it should read: "the best player in a team is..." with the answer stfu yourself. go back to sleep. i prefer raid s&d. just saying. by what mechanism has an infj become a superhero sensing something outside their introvert realm? how many stereotype in one tweet? #lesigh he is a serial plagiarist he is a serial plagiarist though you do realize the one hand is water and not ice? when reality is a stereotype, one cannot improve on describing it. dear senator, denmark might not be the best example anymore other perspective; you know one of your trusted followers has a thing for yin yang and is meticulous about truth. so? :p nope, you merely shared a beautiful picture and i like it. ;) how about that yin yang flip-flop convo? :p to all gamers stressed out over games... *raises hand* these meals are a major cause of your acne outbreaks. #goveggie or #lessmeat at least we can make an approach. :) why judge someone? each and every person has their own struggles in life. want to improve yourself? i understand the feeling, i have the same weak spine in front of our bbq. :s #ohwell :) is this love of self? more like every other day? i experience love of self as the most strongest. and i experience love for my kids stronger as love for my partner. everything? ok. from a logical pov; yes, i disagree. from your personal pov; as stated ok. :p kinda funny, there are actually multiple povs here. 1. you doing things for the first time. ok. 2. you cannot do all things. 3. logically every thing can be done for the first time. 4. logically "there is" is present tense, as in the first is already here and executed and not considered a potential first time. summary, dom ne's are creative. :p thnx, i needed that. hmm, i think i am on to something on how to fix any cod connection... any fariko volunteers that wanna test with me? yup, definitely developing european tendencies... speedos. smh. i just told you we don't work that way. now stop begging. so, now you want to change the way we operate? gtfo. it is exactly what you are saying. why even deny it? and you even continue to change it. /blocked i wasn't referring to the men wearing speedos, but to the focus of naughty k. ;) love works in mysterious ways. change is the key to improvement.spirituality is the operative word. :) with dropbox we have had that for years and including windows and android. apple seems to become more and more of a copycat. merely a balance with a smile between jung's cognitive functions te and fe. :) what is the current literacy rate amongst muslims? planet usape apparently? you do realize what "boko haram" means? . the point is: science should be about improving all of mankind. not a matter of groups pounding their chests. it is not about dividing people by religions, race, sex or nation. but about joining as one to improve humanity. the url you gave merely stated sa, which is highly doubtfull. no usa rates and no european rates. you're a propagandist. the question is, is he still a writer for salon and others where he published plagiarized content? . nothing much, merely kicking trickshotters/snipers ass in ffa. i think should adopt you as well if you get 50 rts. :) then to find a team just joining the conga line. yay! sure go and then to find gamers 300 years of fossil fuels in 300 seconds: read how we work here only for games you need a separate gfx-card. the inboard gfx-chip will suffice for movies. go to your device manager and let it discover new devices, it might not have its device driver installed/activated? errr, do what? but it does help in creativity brainstorm sessions. :) you in da mirror = double scare. don't ever do that again. #stillshaking the one moved has the power to create usefulness in any direction he moves. you are a kind person #infj #truth arrogant pricks. no one can really understand someone else, leave alone themselves. never experienced trees in fall?
