dev leaves minor bug in app -> user gives 1-star rating -> dev fixes bug -> user never changes rating -.- do not touch coding early in the morning and wondering why eclipse for java marks "for i in range(10)" -.- #python after feedly the online reader and chrome extension pro replaces google reader for me now. well, thx for this elaborate review -.- 60fps->impressive:interactive smoke&fluid,fish w/ ai,dynamic maps,subsurface shader,volumetric lighting,self shadow,highres texture #xboxone ok,bye, i'm off for a 0 minutes walk. (you shouldn't first check boundaries and then do the float to int conversion) hübsches doodle; und happy birthday! :) pretty bad, because it's not a name but the title for the wife of the dothraki chieftain. daenerys would be better ;) pretty sure i will like that. i did swipe right to change column so many times :d ios app in progress is nice but for me i'd rather see an android app in the pipeline. who thought this television order would be a good idea? til taking unimpressive operations out of a for loop may result in an impressive performance gain finally had the time to converted my old pop email account to imap #holidays i read the "good news everyone!" in the voice of prof farnsworth :d #futurama i guess productive sunday is already gone by returing at #5am latest futurama episode (s7e19) is nice, but not as total-ninja-super-awesome as in the last couple of weeks. the spring in the 3.5mm input jack is not sufficient and always overrides bluetooth. fixed it like a mechanic. i read and checked my paper so many times i know it by heart. suddenly a paragraph without a source reference appears. were did i get the idea for that again? o.o phd comics: coffee security add flatland by abbott to your next order, if you haven't read it yet. aside from the fact that google reader and google sync were discontinued ;) just got my red one. it's awesome! haha! the calendar sync for outlook only keeps working for existing users, luckily i'm one of them. yes, they went from ms activesync to caldav but ms is a little slow in adding support for that protocol. i updated my android app big bang script with a new ui and optimized it for various screen sizes. any feedback? thank you, i'm going to adjust the layout later. lily uses a strange ui skin on her iphone #himym got a usb flash drive and the famous blue t-shirt as presents from mcs unibnf. thanks "i can practice my english skills" - "but i want to improve my german verbal abilities" -> every conversation i had with foreign students just testing out some different evolutionary steps the plot showing what points converge to which of the three zeroes turned out more impressive than expected that was like 3 days ago...or on the internet this was a lifetime ago :d nice slider. can't really say how old i am i'm probably the only one who didn't know there's some kind of holiday today in fribourg. view through 4 empty rooms nope, i'm not. a woman just entered the room excusing for being late and then asking me where everyone remains :d #lasttweet what? :d i always choose the best team members. what a commit. default files. files without filetype. randomly deleted colons in css. username&password for db. deleted half of my work. : ha emu e bon becho, bi aso anschiinend gnue dert :) stupid team project! they commit broken code, they write incorrect stuff in the paper and they don't even help building presentation slides. ha! in one of the projects my teammate quit the course (3 weeks ago; he told me now!). i can do everything myself. that's honestly better ;) maybe the ambiguity is on purpose..? the value of the bounty i got this week for doing good work was higher than the money i actually earned while doing said work :) thx for the review but i really don't have a master of arts. the reflection on kepler from the blue planet in today's google doodle is nicely done. the blue planet isn't the earth as the orbit is too elliptical. and for a comet like halley it's too circular. it might be a colored eris :) programming languages used this year: java, javascript, matlab, php, python #code2013 yesterday, everybody smoked his last cigar, took his last drink, swore his last oath, sat last on his couch & ate his last unhealthy meal? solving the tsp with 411 cities for the project of the probabilistic algorithms lecture. you have to use matlab in convex and (a lot of) java in rendering. pervasive is partly hci stuff. maybe this helps deciding didn't ask for another choice and course description lists it (again) but tasks are easy and short :) hehe, but they were weekly. and not just matlab, sometimes just theoretical problems to solve on paper. sounds like the description of one of my classifiers.. i have to buy a new smartphone for this fancy cover “ detailed shots of htc's dot view nice, how long has google been doing this results comparisons? "it said something about 'merge conflict', so i send you the code in a mail." every team-member. every week. :( obviously there is no such thing as at other universities where you have to use git. most useful exercises ever (in retrospect). no problem, mistakes can happen. good thing we always use tests, right? right? :) all new episodes and i have to prepare for a presentation :/ new external hdd vs external hdd that fell on the floor while writing data (same model) watching #iihfcze on ?eská televize because official stream doesn't work. what it's like to own a tesla model s - a cartoonist's review of his magical space car - the oatmeal $226 since october 2010 sounds about right. 808 cube beat yes, this was 3 years ago. i don't remember more. if there was anything to remark i've probably written it in the lecture survey :) this is my 2^9 th tweet. interesting talks on the first day of #3rdmumiatrainingschool. looking forward to the next lectures. created in less than 10s...it's only the color (0/128/128). redundancy in :) woah, i tracked 3.5 million steps with my i'm in the top 0.6%. interesting talks on the first day of #clef2014. looking forward to #replab2014 and #pan2014. correlation does not imply causation. maybe you tweet because you lose followers :) simpsons-futurama episode: tsp is class p, fermat's little theorem, riemann hypothesis, prime number theorem, etc. nice, congrats! i can't download prey on my android tablet acer iconia tab a500 (wifi-only). it's not compatible with my device. what now?? <3 support! my student plan was activated within less than an hour! the official update may arrive next week ^^ a reasonable step back to android's openness rt we're reviewing our bootloader policy. what the hell are you doing ?!?! na, i was at work. we gonna solve them in the lecture (again) ^^ lol as if they read our talk on #fb rt new option for the "following" page: view tweets from the accounts a user follows. what do you do for a living, microsoft? making money on phones...by patent trolling. sue 'em if you can't beat 'em ^^ what's the deal with the correction of ps9? it's still a 'nef' but no reason given why nor any advice on how to improve it further cool, your brain is a 5 million core 9 hertz computer ps09 is fixed. take heed of the comments i added with the task tag 'miko'. thx build highly cohesive* classes and have loose coupling** between those; eh? // *readability & reuse **extensible & flexible omg haxx0rz apple iz copying just liek my science tests in third graed!!!11 #stupidcomment honestly, i'm pleased apple's making these changes, because it will force google to reach for more. and this is what we all want. the platform is open enough for me to switch to a customrom with the latest kernel and android version ;d ...and therefore uses far less memory :) i don't care (anymore) about htc sense lol! :d but i finally set up the vpn-unibe. that was the only thing ios did from day one and android had problems. if it's too good to be true, it probably is. there is always exactly one screw left if you disassemble a notebook and put it together an hour later. what is the point with those private twitter profiles and protected tweets? gotta send a follow request?! seriously?! cool post. i'm going to "fwd: like rt +1" that! *social media douchebag* that wifi keyboard works perfectly with my iconia tab. no tedious setup, no missing drivers or anything alike woah! even copy/paste and the special keys (music & volume control, search, homescreen, lock, calendar, ...) are operative! i was on a shopping trip with my sister. fancy new thing are cool, but i am almost out of money three days after pay day :$
