 does heroes of the storm count? #e3 + following some game people = one bajillion tweets per second. bringing new meaning to the term "board member" because wool things are more volumetric, and flat/spiky things like leaves/teeth (and road) look better as felt. cause you're uninformed? sudan, uganda, cambodia. (genocides) yang xinhai, ramadan mansour, luis garavito. (mass murderers) doesn't matter much. plenty of them support it. current 'alpha males' didn't start patriarchy either. it's not about the money. it's about promising 1 video a month and only delivering 4 vids in 2 years. no, pc advisor. inkjet printers do not fall under the category of color laser printers... and no, . anything that has a sticker saying "xerox" is not an hp officejet. nor is the 8100 a laser printer. i'm really saddened that you have macro photos of tablet screens, test photos on phones, but no sample scans for printers. he has a tiny point but misses the parts where reviews drive purchases, and where letsplays are transformative in nature. i really quite like it that red bull will just up and fund stuff like danny macaskill's imaginate: availability of old/obscure/quirky/bad games is not a bad thing. the prominence and promotion of those games is. it sucks when your phone suddenly won't read a simcard any more. it sucks even more when your pc breaks while looking for a solution. =( hurray for dutch sportsball, huh? i was on and noticed all the 3d models work just fine on my nexus 7. *thumbs up* for crossplatform functionality! the current bundle is worth it just for 's fantastic pineapple smash crew. today, fear soaked fabric as over 50 victims suffered a gruesome fate. my wardrobe shrunk from 100cm to only 57cm. (1/3) among the casualties are 6 tops, 18 tees, 10 longsleeves, 8 dress shirts, 5 pants, 6 shorts and a suit. (2/3) just saw fireworks in the #netherlands , wondering if it's for #fifaworldcup #bravscol or some u.s. expats celebrating #independenceday man, what a waste of a tweet, talking about responses you don't like... you could have spent it on making a "wtf is?" video ;) but today is not that day!! because its spelled "götze" and 'oe' is the internationally accepted spelling when you don't have access to diacritics. is this in response to the recent gamasutra article / ftc quote? bought a new pc with windows 8.1 hoping it wouldn't be so bad now with the updates. after a day i'm on the verge of a mental breakdown... =( seriously. who had the idea to replace the standard calculator by a full screen app? i don't need 1920x1200 to multiply some numbers. instead you want these. chocolate/marzipan/sugarsprinkles. don't know the english name. yeah i've been looking into similar things, like the stuff from . not sure what i end up choosing yet. also, w8.1 apparently has regular calc, but also an appified version (as default) for added confusion and frustration.*sigh* definitely gonna give it a try. seems to be the most feature rich one, and i love the price of free. right now? i don't really know. there's no way to disable the metro bit (outside of 3rd party (cont) pix or it didn't happen. (or linx) maybe they're taking the adage "all publicity is good publicity" a tad too literal? heh. i like how they call forbes 'unprofessional'. it's only a century old business magazine, after all. well, #dota2ti4 championship final was a bit of a letdown... very one-sided, almost like the brazil #fifa2014 matches earlier this month. how come nl/eu prices for businesses are so skewed? i almost understand $140 -> €140 but there's no way $400 should -> €540($727) statistics! colors! games! graphs! numbers! info! money! jerbs! exclamation marks! #gamedev ooh. freddie mercury! i loved his music in neverending story as well. but why is that spiderman quote in there? your bundle currently costs. ?€ i thought that was funny. remember when you mentioned ru-ua-eu war? it's already happening on kickstarter, according to areal! this is a good looking kickstarter! love the vid and the header gifs. (oh and the game itself looks interesting too) i wouldn't hurt the proverbial fly, but those damn mosquitos... just killed at least two dozen of the bitey fuckers. with you being you, i'm not sure if that's asap or never. how come art software always has such a shitty gui? i'd assume that designers would understand/appreciate usability. will this work with the regular pc forum accounts or do we have to make new ones? would be handy to have that integrated. gotta be honest here, these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail. a downside of 3d, or maybe a render/filter issue? can hardly wait for pc version x. what i've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work. yeah i know they're 2x. i scaled the image down to 50% first to check my gut. does ingame have normals or something? i just finished my last game for the day, this should be a nice way to unwind. it really depends on the quality of the stuff, much like chocolate. often i find they add too much powder, too. i... uh... what? dafuq? don't worry. you will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals. how are the podcasts rubbish? only thing edited for (the yt version of) that are the commercials, right? i get the removal of streamed 'regular' music, i do. but background music from games? and beyond that, do you think that (1/2) it should apply to games in general? (textures+models+etc=©, too) you generally say that streaming is a transformative art. technically, this is a mobile game. and i'm not sure i would call this 'playing'. yup, salticidae are definitely the bestest, coolest and most awesomest spiders. no. you'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables, when such a simple command is all you need. ooh. sanchez. i strongly approve of this. i'm in that camp. everyone* has a smartphone now, which makes it a true -personal- computer. the biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus. sports thrive on spectators. (semi)finals get more views. says it right there "? the jester race a song by in flames" given that you regularly do long takes, though, this one felt "slighly off". (j/k well done zooc) lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy. i think you're mixing up gone home and dear esther. not many people argued gone home wasn't a game, just not a good one. i think you should do a combination. good projects deserve love, but also one/sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned. it might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid? nope, nope, nope, this looks decent. hurrah! you didn't call it the a/s/l challenge. +1 for knowing the actual charity's name. heck, look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box... and dolla dolla bills yo. (also my shirt) seems kind of relevant in this case too. from several perspectives. you're right on the first account. many would argue about the 2nd; the nature of debates is divisive. what's the crest for that? that actually seems interesting data, yeah. i wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that. using your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving. sorry mr snail... liking youtubers isn't a problem either. which leaves "harassing" as the only issue. threat? or... treat? simple yet clear marking of gluten/lactose/vegetarian/etc foods. good on you, germany. i know, right. you're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time. for me, personally, it's like a tv show. i can relax to it because it's more passive than articles, yet is not supershort. quite an innovative new 'exclusive' system; just exclude yourself from a lot of games.wonder where this will go? you mean "asshole" culture, within the gaming and internet audience, right? i'm pretty sure that's what you mean. should the flooding work that way? don't you need 2 holes; one for water in, one for air out? dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness. jim, try monster rehab. it's not nearly as sugary as regular (about 25%) but it doesn't taste like deat-... i mean sweeteners. unless your licence gets voided, in which case you pay €35 and €70. personally, i just wait for price drops. and what if it gets voided before you managed to install/play? it was a hypothetical. hence why he says "at your own risk". it might work fine, it might cost you. definitely think that you do 3 can stop early. a game has max 20 minutes, if it impresses you sooner, good on it. ooh, this is pretty. any info on how it's done? looks like uprezzed render, sure, but any special texture approach? what, you're able to not hate someone you disagree with? is this some kind of magic? are you a wizerds? it is rather uncanny... just binge-read the entirety of 's comic. it's gooood. with 300+ employees, they're well past the 'dunbar number'; a group of ~150 is what our human brains can manage. didn't know i, a european, could send emails about net neutrality to us gov. europeans unite! i've always likened dear esther to a book or movie. you can press play/pause, but you don't really have any agency. personally, i'd love physical media as an option, if it were just that. but most games nowadays are just a dvd + steam code. next bundle? you have your own npc and you're giving out games? conspiracyyy!!!! he's an author at destructoid. he is games media. conrad, thanks for making the distinction.
