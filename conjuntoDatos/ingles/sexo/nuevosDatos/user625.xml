i'm watching #dantesinferno on #getglue god it's so slow today (minus these 2 theaters that have like 40 people per) ready for a smoke and then i think i'll be ready to finally tackle this trifle sitting at work waiting for my xenergy drink to kick in. god i hate the cleaner manager over at the cinema's. what a pretentious prick leaving my ga with the instructions to "guard" #worktweet 2 1/2 hours to freedom. craving chipotle so bad maybe i should have gotten food instead of makeup during my break #girlproblems hungry enough that it tastes like i've been chewing on a balloon. got offered the bar back position here at the cinema ???????????? been at this job about 4 months and i got offered the job that most people are gunning for just by minding my own. tbh i got nominated for this job being that at least 2 bartenders requested me by name when asked who they might want. late night solo rips. this is just how i roll sometimes it takes all of 10 minutes for me to cycle through 12 different versions of myself. i wonder if she realizes her make up looks like a mimes? i think it's time for another bowl. not the news i wanted to hear ???? 7 pm can not come fast enough... not like i'll be home till about 10:30 ughh i am so exhausted trying not to fall asleep in the car. creepers? that's that shit i don't like!! feel the world beneath your feet sorry. silly me. fuck over analyzing.... and while i'm at it... fuck my life too ???? it's often hard to tell if i'm being overly paranoid or overly trusting. sorry but i didn't post the ad that i'm credited with on your page. i hate people who just act like my dog is dangerous just cause he's a pitbull. fuck y'all. the werewolf vs the vampire woman lol oh god. not sure what's wrong but all my joints from my mid back down hurts so fucking bad. hopes these tokes of thc help. put on "the possession" and now the whole crew has been sucked in. listening to devendra banhart while watching the clouds slide over the moon. just got my first barback schedule ????????

so fuckin glad to be home with my bong and my dude well i can hear the baby bird that i found the eggshell for that's above my walkway/ outside my window bout to get high and play me some skyrim before bed. on that keeping my bong clean grind restless yet exhausted can't even concentrate on that right now and in no way shape or form do i know what to say, so i'll just eat my fruitypebbles n smoke a bowl no more excuses, it's time to get back in shape. i've been telling myself this all summer but have been through so many changes. enough is enough though. good luck girl!! i have a new # by the way but send me yours and ill hit you up w. it and we can be workout support buddies lol! trying to figure out a good way to organize this, but i think the best way is to jump in and sort it out as i get more comfortable. i run and walk every day. i'm not out of shape. but i need to start actually working out again cause i used to be in better shape thanks, and i'm honestly into hiit more though lol. i just run for a couple miles a day, and bike twice a week, but i need to get my hiit back in there and get consistent with my yoga, cause i just practice moves lately rather than full flows. have the bus very much not to myself today lol #ebbandflow fuck traffic ???? maybe got a new bed? guess i'll see when i get home tonight. tired from all this effort. the ride home is so much smoother with a full front tire :) ???? if i told you i was lonely, would you want to get close and hold me? there's a fuck ton of stuff in my garage. resistant to change #taurusrising
